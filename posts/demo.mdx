This is my first post from my blog + portfolio website. I won't be writing much in this post but let me tell you a little about this site.

## Styling

Let's see how different elements are styled. I also use this blog as reference to check how the content are rendered into HTML from Markdown.

_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

The code snippets look like this. They have the file name at the top and also you can copy the code ( desktop users can hover, mobile users can tap ). The theme is inspired from the [v2 Tailwind website](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

```javascript:folder/file.js
console.log('Code snippets look like this');
console.log('The theme is custom made');
console.log('The font is Fira Code');
```

> Blockquotes look like this!

The lists look like this and also can be nested.

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

The tables look like this.

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

Since the blog uses **MDX**, we can add interactive react components like this counter below.

<Counter />

or this questionnaire below.

<Questionnaire
  question="What is the best social media site?"
  answers={['Twitter', 'Facebook', 'Samiptter', 'Reddit']}
  correctAnswer={2}
/>

## Tech stack

Now lets looks at the tech stack used to build the site.

### 1. Next.js

Next.js is one of the most popular frameworks out there and my go-to for building web application. It has SSR and SSG baked into it and they are super easy to use.

### 2. TailwindCSS

I am not a big fan of UI libraries like Bootstrap or Material-UI. I prefer to use TailwindCSS, because I have much more control over the styling. TailwindCSS makes it easy and quick to style your website and it works really well with React components.

### 3. MDX

MDX is the magician behind the curtain. MDX is an extended version of Markdown that also allows you to use React components. This will help me write more interactive content.

### 4. TypeScript

Once you start using TypeScript, there is no going back. It saves me from so much of the hassle. I use TypeScript in as much projects that I can. The best part about TypeScript is that you can use it incrementally and any valid JavaScript code is a valid TypeScript code.

## Conclusion

There you have it these are the 4 major technologies that I used to build my portfolio + blog site.
