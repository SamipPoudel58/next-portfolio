This is my first post from my blog + portfolio website. I won't be writing much in this post but let me tell you a little about this site. Lets see how different elements are styled.

---

_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

```javascript:folder/file.js
console.log('Code snippets look like this');
console.log('The theme is custom made');
console.log('The font is Fira Code');
```

> Blockquotes look like this!

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

Since the blog uses **MDX**, we can add interactive react components like this counter below.

<Counter />

or this questionnaire below.

<Questionnaire
  question="What is the best social media site?"
  answers={['Twitter', 'Facebook', 'Samiptter', 'Reddit']}
  correctAnswer={2}
/>

Now lets looks at the tech stack used to build the site.

---

### 1. React

React is one of the most popular JS library out there. I chose react to build my blog site because I have been working with react for about a year and it is the framework that I find the most comfortable to use.

### 2. Gatsby

Gatsby is a static site generator as its generally known as but there is more to gatsby than what meets the eye. There were plenty of features that I really liked, especially the image plugins. And since gatsby uses react under the hood, it was a cherry on top.

### 3. Contentful

For the CMS, I went with the most popular in the gatsby-plugin market Contentful, because of that it was fairly easy to get started with as the docs were really great and straight forward. I had some issues using the richTextField and its limitation and so I used markdown fields instead which are much more convenient for me.

### 4. Netlify

I have been fan of Netlify ever since the first time I used it, so netlify was my go to choice to deploy the blog site as its continous integration is smooth as butter.

## Conclusion

There you have it these are the 4 major technologies that I used to build my portfolio + blog site.
