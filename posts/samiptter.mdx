## Why Samiptter?

Ever since the first day, I started learning "Web Development", my dream project was to build a social media site. Probably, the reason was I was blown away by "Facebook" when I first used it back in 2011. The whole world was in it. That was when I got interested in the "Internet" and the endless possibility that it brought with it. That was the moment I knew that:

## Dawn of Samiptter

After 4 months of learning i.e around August of 2020, I tried building a "twitter clone". I knew I didn't have enough knowledge to build it, but to my surprise, I was able to build a very bare-bones version of it. I remember the authentication was so hacky because I really didn't know much about it. Now that I think about it, though it was terrible
the most important thing was I learned many things, and these kinds of risks pay off. Then after I gained some more knowledge and experience, I couldn't stop myself from going back to that project and rebuilding it from the ground up.

I was using `react-bootstrap` initially for styling. I had almost built everything with it, but at a point, I was unsatisfied with how generic it looked. So I decided to redo the styling in the frontend. I fired up Figma and designed a brand new UI. Instead of `react-bootstrap` I wrote custom CSS using `Sass`. Later I also made a cute logo.

To this day, I still keep on adding features to Samiptter from time to time. It has become a playground for me to try new things and implement cool features.
